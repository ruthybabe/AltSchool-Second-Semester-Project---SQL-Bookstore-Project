### AltSchool Second Semester Project - SQL Bookstore Project

#### This project utilizes Jupyter Notebook and the ipython-sql extension to answer real-world business questions from a bookstore database, which includes the following tables: authors, books, customers, orders, order_items, and reviews.

#### **Key Insights Extracted:**

#### Top 5 Most Popular Books – Based on order frequency, sorted by author name (descending)

#### Author Revenue – Total sales revenue per author

#### Top 5 Customers – By number of orders, sorted by name

#### Book Order Lookup – Orders containing book_id = 1

#### Lowest Rated Books – Detailed reviews for the bottom 5 books

#### **This project demonstrates practical SQL skills, including joins, aggregations, filtering, and real-world data analysis.**
